3	3123	C	Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding automatic identification systems (AIS)?	"AIS is a global tracking system that relies upon INMARSAT C service to communicate vessel position and other safety related information to similarly equipped vessels, aircraft and shore stations within the area."	"AIS is a short-range 3 cm X-band radar system that automatically sends a vessel's position and other safety related information to similarly equipped vessels, aircraft and shore stations within the area."	"AIS is a short-range VHF-FM system that automatically broadcasts a vessel's position and other safety related information frequently to similarly equipped vessels, aircraft and shore stations within the area."	"AIS is a one-way centrally managed system that requires the local VTS to send commands to instruct each vessel to broadcast position and other safety related information to similarly equipped vessels, aircraft and shore stations within the area."
3	3124	A	Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding automatic identification systems (AIS)?	"AIS is a short-range VHF-FM system that automatically broadcasts a vessel's position, course, speed and other safety related information to all those with similar equipment in the area."	"AIS is a one-way centrally managed system that requires the local VTS to send commands to instruct each vessel to broadcast position, course, speed and other safety related information to all those with similar equipment in the area."	"AIS is a global tracking system that relies upon INMARSAT C service to communicate vessel position, course, speed and other safety related information to all those with similar equipment in the area."	"AIS is a short-range 3 cm X-band radar system that automatically sends a vessel's position, course, speed and other safety related information to all those with similar equipment within the area."
3	3125	B	Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding automatic identification systems (AIS)?	"AIS is designed to replace ARPA, maneuvering boards, and visual bearings as a means to ascertain the risk of collision."	AIS provides near real-time information regarding another vessel's speed over ground and heading regardless of visibility.	AIS will not provide information on another vessel if that vessel is indistinguishable in radar sea clutter.	AIS can be relied upon as the sole means to determine course changes due to other AIS equipped traffic.
3	3126	D	Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding automatic identification systems (AIS)?	AIS will not provide information on another vessel if that vessel is indistinguishable in radar sea clutter.	AIS can be relied upon as the sole means to determine risk of collision and safe speed.	"AIS is designed to replace ARPA, maneuvering boards, and visual bearings as a means to ascertain the risk of collision."	"AIS provides the other vessel's identity, dimensions and navigational status regardless of visibility."
3	3127	C	Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding automatic identification systems (AIS) ?	AIS cannot be used to make passing arrangements because the system is not capable of this type of ship-to-ship communications.	AIS cannot be used to make passing arrangements because the ship-to-ship text messaging feature is for emergency use only.	AIS can be used to make passing arrangements via ship-to-ship text messaging but a vessel operator is not relieved from the requirement to sound whistle signals or make arrangements via bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone.	AIS can be used to make passing arrangements via ship-to-ship text massaging thus relieving a vessel operator from making such arrangements via bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone or signaling intent to pass via whistle signals.
3	3128	B	Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding automatic identification systems (AIS) ?	AIS may be used to make passing arrangements via ship-to-ship text messaging thus relieving a vessel operator from sounding whistle signals or making contact via radiotelephone.	AIS may be used to make passing arrangements via ship-to-ship text messaging but a vessel operator is still required to sound whistle signals unless the arrangement is made via radiotelephone.	AIS cannot be used to make passing arrangements because the system does not have the ability to communicate from ship-to-ship in this manner.	AIS cannot be used to make passing arrangements because the use of the ship-to-ship text messaging feature in this way is prohibited.
3	3129	A	Which of the following statements is TRUE regarding automatic identification systems (AIS) ?	"The master may, at his/her discretion, turn off the AIS if he/she believes that it may compromise the safety or security of the vessel."	Under no circumstances shall AIS be turned off while underway as this could endanger the vessel and those around her.	AIS is always required to be operating if the vessel is in or in the vicinity of a VTS area.	AIS is always required to be operating if the vessel is within 100 nautical miles of the coastline.
3	3130	B	When may the automatic identification system (AIS) be switched off?	At anytime as long as it is properly logged.	At the Master's professional judgment.	Only when the vessel is at anchor or in port.	Under no circumstance.
